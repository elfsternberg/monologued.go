# MONOLOGUED

Monologued is an implementation of an
[RFC1288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1288) protocol server in Go.

That's right.  Monologued is a
*[Finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol)* server.

# WHY‽‽‽‽

While what I really wanted was to
[learn Rust](https://github.com/elfsternberg/monologued), work decided that
Go was a better choice.  Since I have to learn it, this seemed like the 
best way to go about it.  Still not thrilled with the decision, but maybe
I'll get a blog post out of it.

# Status

Monologued is still very much not working.  Don't even bother
downloading.  It's mostly something to cut my teeth on while I try to
figure out how Go works.

# Thanks

Thanks to my friend Nathaniel for the answer to my original question,
"In a movie, when the villain is explaining his plans at length, what is
that called?"  Nathaniel explained that "He's monologuing," and now you
know why it has that name.
